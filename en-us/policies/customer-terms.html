                        carefully. If you are a Customer (defined below), these Customer Terms govern your access and
                        use of our Services. If you are being invited to a Community set up by a Customer, the User
                        Terms of Service (the "User Terms") govern your access and use of the Services. We're happy

                        Contract on behalf of Customer. Please make sure you have the necessary authority to enter into

                        you are the Customer.

                        and otherwise exercise its rights under the Contract. If Customer elects to replace you as the

                        If we believe that there is a violation of the Contract that can simply be remedied by
                        Customer's removal of certain Customer Data or Customer's disabling of a Non-Unaty Product, we
                        will, in most cases, ask Customer to take direct action rather than intervene. However, we may
                        directly step in and take what we determine to be appropriate action, if Customer does not take
                        appropriate action, or if we believe there is a credible risk of harm to us, the Services,
                        Authorized Users, or any third parties.

                        Customer isn't the only one with responsibilities; we have some, too. We will (a) make the

                        not use or process Customer Data for any purpose without Customer's prior written instructions;

                        The protection of Customer Data is a top priority for us so we will maintain administrative,
                        physical, and technical safeguards at a level not materially less protective than as described
                        in our Data Security page. Those safeguards will include measures for preventing unauthorized
                        access, use, modification, deletion and disclosure of Customer Data by our personnel. Before
                        sharing Customer Data with any of our third party service providers, we will ensure that the
                        third party maintains, at a minimum, reasonable data practices for maintaining the
                        confidentiality and security of Customer Data and preventing unauthorized access. Customer (not
                        us) bears sole responsibility for adequate security, protection and backup of Customer Data when
                        in Customer's or its representatives' or agents' possession or control or when Customer chooses
                        to use unencrypted gateways (e.g., IRC/XMPP clients) to connect to the Services. We are not
                        responsible for what Customer's Authorized Users or Non-Unaty Products do with Customer Data.

                        waiver of that right. No waiver under the Contract will be effective unless made in writing and
                        signed by an authorized representative of the party being deemed to have granted the waiver.

                        The Contract will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. If any
                        provision of the Contract is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law,
                        the provision will be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the
                        objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining
                        provisions of the Contract will remain in effect.

                        Neither party may assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations hereunder, whether by
                        operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be
                        unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign the Contract in
                        its entirety (including all Order Forms), without consent of the other party, to a corporate
                        affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all
                        or substantially all of its assets. Customer will keep its billing and contact information
                        current at all times by notifying Unaty of any changes. Any purported assignment in violation of
                        this section is void. A party's sole remedy for any purported assignment by the other party in
                        breach of this section will be, at the non-assigning party's election, termination of the
                        Contract upon written notice to the assigning party. In the event of such a termination by
                        Customer, we will refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of all
                        subscriptions after the effective date of termination. Subject to the foregoing, the Contract
                        will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective successors and permitted
                        assigns.

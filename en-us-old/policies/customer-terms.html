                        called the Unaty App Directory where some Non-Unaty Products are available for connection. THESE

                        The protection of Customer Data is a top priority for us so we will maintain administrative,

                        access, use, modification, deletion and disclosure of Customer Data by our personnel. Before
                        sharing Customer Data with any of our third party service providers, we will ensure that the
                        third party maintains, at a minimum, reasonable data practices for maintaining the
                        confidentiality and security of Customer Data and preventing unauthorized access. Customer (not

                        in Customer's or its representatives' or agents' possession or control or when Customer chooses
                        to use unencrypted gateways (e.g., IRC/XMPP clients) to connect to the Services. We are not

                        As our business evolves, we may change these Customer Terms and the other components of the
                        Contract (except any Order Forms). If we make a material change to the Contract, we will provide
                        Customer with reasonable notice prior to the change taking effect, either by emailing the email
                        address associated with Customer's account or by messaging Customer through the Services.
                        Customer can review the most current version of the Customer Terms at any time by visiting this
                        page and by visiting the most current versions of the other pages that are referenced in the
                        Contract. The materially revised Contract will become effective on the date set forth in our
                        notice, and all other changes will become effective upon posting of the change. If Customer (or
                        any Authorized User) accesses or uses the Services after the effective date, that use will
                        constitute Customer's acceptance of any revised terms and conditions.

                        Neither party may assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations hereunder, whether by
                        operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be
                        unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign the Contract in
                        its entirety (including all Order Forms), without consent of the other party, to a corporate
                        affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all
                        or substantially all of its assets. Customer will keep its billing and contact information
                        current at all times by notifying Unaty of any changes. Any purported assignment in violation of
                        this section is void. A party's sole remedy for any purported assignment by the other party in
                        breach of this section will be, at the non-assigning party's election, termination of the
                        Contract upon written notice to the assigning party. In the event of such a termination by
                        Customer, we will refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of all
                        subscriptions after the effective date of termination. Subject to the foregoing, the Contract
                        will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective successors and permitted
                        assigns.

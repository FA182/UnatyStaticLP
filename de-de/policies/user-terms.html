                        Customer has separately agreed to our Customer Terms of Service or entered into a written
                        agreement with us (in either case, the "Contract") that permitted Customer to create and
                        configure a Community so that you and others could join (each invitee granted access to the
                        Services, including you, is an "Authorized User"). The Contract contains our commitment to
                        deliver the Services to Customer, who may then invite Authorized Users to join its
                        Community/ies). When an Authorized User (including, you) submits content or information to the
                        Services, such as messages or files ("Customer Data"), you acknowledge and agree that the
                        Customer Data is owned by Customer and the Contract provides Customer with many choices and
                        control over that Customer Data. For example, Customer may provision or deprovision access to
                        the Services, enable or disable third party integrations, manage permissions, retention and
                        export settings, transfer or assign Communities, share channels, or consolidate your Community
                        or channels with other Communities or channels, and these choices and instructions may result in
                        the access, use, disclosure, modification or deletion of certain or all Customer Data. Please
                        check out our Help Center pages for more detail on our different Service plans and the options
                        available to Customer.

                        Customer Data or taking other action, we will, in most cases, ask Customer to take action rather
                        than intervene. We may directly step in and take what we determine to be appropriate action
                        (including disabling your account) if Customer does not take appropriate action or we believe
                        there is a credible risk of harm to us, the Services, Authorized Users, or any third parties. IN
                        NO EVENT WILL YOU OR WE HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR FOR

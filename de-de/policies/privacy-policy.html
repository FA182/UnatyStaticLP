                            user conferences, etc.) you may have with Unaty.

                            Furthermore, if you do not agree with the privacy policy, please do also not access or use
                            the Websites or any other aspect of Unaty's business.

                            This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party applications or software that

                            use of the Services (the "Terms of Services for Customers"), including the processing of any

                            "Customer

                            Unaty may collect and receive Customer Data, Content Data and data about data ("Metadata")
                            in a
                            variety of ways:

                        <div>
                            <strong>Customer Data</strong><br/>
                            Customers or individuals granted access to a Community by a Customer
                            ("Administrators") routinely submit Customer Data to Unaty when using the Services: To
                            create or
                            update a Community account, you or your Customer (e.g., your Club/Organization) supply Unaty
                            with an email address, phone number, password, domain and/or similar account details. In
                            addition, Customers that purchase a Products provide Unaty (or its payment processor Stripe,
                            Inc.) with billing details such as credit card information, banking information and/or a
                            billing
                            address.

                        <div>
                            <strong>Content Data</strong><br/>
                            Unaty contains and therefore receives data that is created in the
                            Communities
                            like Events, Roles, Personal Messages and Conversations. Most of these data is directly
                            connectable to Customers and Users and is therefore personal data. Unaty emphasizes
                            explicitly
                            that Content data is not used for any purposes but generating anonymous metadata (see
                            below).
                            Content Data is neither sold nor used for usable services for third parties or monetized in
                            any
                            other way. These Data is not accessible to Unaty employees or third parties.

                        <div>
                            <strong>Metadata</strong><br/>
                            Unaty collects, generates and/or receives general Metadata:
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <strong>Services Metadata</strong><br/>
                            When an Administrator interacts with the Services, metadata is
                            generated
                            that provides additional context about the way Administrators work. For example, Unaty logs
                            the

                            As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our
                            servers automatically collect information when you access or use our Websites or Services
                            and
                            record it in log files. This log data may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the
                            address of the web page visited before using the Website or Services, browser type and
                            settings,
                            the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and
                            plugins,

                            Unaty collects information about devices accessing the Services,
                            including
                            type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique
                            device
                            identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this Metadata often depends on
                            the
                            type of device used and its settings.

                            third-parties
                            that helps us approximate your location. We may, for example, use a business address
                            submitted
                            by your employer, or an IP address received from your browser or device to determine
                            approximate
                            location. Unaty may also collect location information from devices in accordance with the
                            consent process provided by your device.

                            that help us collect Metadata. The Websites and Services may also include cookies and

                            tracking technologies of third parties, which may collect Metadata about you via the

                            and Services and across other websites and online services. For more details about how we

                            <strong>Third Party Services</strong><br/>
                            Customer can choose to permit or restrict Third Party Services for their
                            Community. Typically, Third Party Services are software that integrate with our Services,
                            and
                            Customer can permit its Administrators to enable and disable these integrations for their
                            Community. Once enabled, the provider of a Third Party Service may share certain information
                            with Unaty. For example, if an E-Mail-Marketing application is enabled to permit email lists
                            to
                            be imported to a Community, we may receive user name and email address of Administrators,
                            along
                            with additional information that the application has elected to make available to Unaty to
                            facilitate the integration. Administrators should check the privacy settings and notices in
                            these Third Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to Unaty. When a Third
                            Party
                            Service is enabled, Unaty is authorized to connect and access Metadata made available to
                            Unaty
                            in accordance with our agreement with the Third Party Provider. We do not, however, receive
                            or
                            store passwords for any of these Third Party Services when connecting them to the Services.
                            Generally, no one is under a statutory or contractual obligation to provide any Customer
                            Data,
                            Content Data or Metadata (collectively, "Information"). However, certain Information is
                            collected automatically and, if some Information, such as Community setup details, is not
                            provided, we may be unable to provide the Services.

                            Customer Data will be used by Unaty in accordance with Customer's instructions, including
                            any
                            applicable Terms of Service for Customer, and as required by applicable law. Unaty is a
                            processor of Customer Data and Customer is the controller. Customer may, for example, use
                            the
                            Services to grant and remove access to a Community, assign roles and configure settings,
                            access,
                            modify, export, share and remove Customer Data and otherwise apply its policies to the
                            Services.
                            Content Data is never used by Unaty for Business. Anonymous generated Data around Content
                            Creation and Usage is collected as part of our Metadata, which is never connected to single
                            Users or Customers. Unaty will make Content Data accessible only to public authorities when
                            requested, for example when illegal use of Unaty is indicated.

                                    For example, we may improve search functionality by using Metadata to help determine

                            of a community and therefore not enough to delete all of your Personal Data.

                        <div>
                            At Unaty, there is only an extremely narrow circle of employees that gets in touch with your
                            Personal Data. Therefore, Unaty is not required to register an official data Protection
                            Officer
                            to authorities. However, we designated one employee to explicitly take care of data
                            protection.

                            Data protection law in certain jurisdictions differentiates between the "controller" and
                            "processor" of information. In general, Customer is the controller of Customer Data. The
                            Unaty
                            Technologies GmbH is the controller of Metadata and a processor of Customer Data.
